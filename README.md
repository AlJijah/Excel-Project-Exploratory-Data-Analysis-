# Excel-Project
I worked on this project during my attendance at Focus Technologies' bootcamp. A survey was used to get the data.The study topic "Enhancing Ghanaian Agriculture Through AI-Based Agricultural Software" is exploratory data analysis.

### Project Overview:
This data analyst capstone project aims to conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on “enhancing Ghanaian agriculture through AI-based agricultural software” using Google Sheets on the survey collected.

#Data Import and Overview: The questionnaire was the major research instrument used for the survey. The dataset was saved as an Excel document and later imported into Google Sheets for further work. The data set was further studied to understand the major components of the findings. 


# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Some of the data was missing. It was assumed that those data were not complete and could affect the findings. Because missing data could affect the validity of the analysis, most of them were deleted. This ensured consistency in the analysis. However, some datasets were refilled using logical reasoning. For example, some respondents failed to answer whether they are farmers or not but indicated that they were rearing animals, which is also farming. Logically, this respondent is a farmer. Other data cleaning and processing processes were performed to get a valid dataset for the analysis. Some responses were codified to make sense of the data.

#Descriptive Statistics and Visualization
This section of the report presents the descriptive statistics of the study. The results discuss the age categories of the farmers, educational background, farming type and many more.

#Insight from the data

#Age categories of respondents
The data depicts a relatively large proportion of the farmers being within the age bracket of 18–30 years, of which the majority are males. This shows that agriculture is largely dominated by men, with low levels of female participation. Agricultural agencies such as the Ministry of Agriculture should map out programs that will encourage female participation in the agricultural sector. 
#Educational level of respondents
The data reveal that most of the respondents are individuals with Bachelor's degrees (75.8%) followed by those with secondary school certificates. 

 #Farming type of Farmers. 
From the data, we see that a fair number of the respondents practiced crop farming with very few into livestock farming. This may be due to the difficulty and complexity associated with livestock farming.

 
#Ai awareness and future prospects.
The statistics of the dataset show that the majority of the farmers knew about AI technology, but the fear of cost and technical training has been a barrier for them to implement. Visualizations have been made to depict key findings of the research. The charts below show the awareness and willingness to adopt AI agricultural technology in the future. 
We observe an abysmal level of AI adoption rates. However, there will be massive improvements in adoption levels in the future. 
 
 
#Lastly, the study also identified various problems that AI can solve; among the enterprising ones are management, planning, general operations, pest control, soil nutrients analysis, irrigation, pest-destroying crops, planting, and disease control, among others.
